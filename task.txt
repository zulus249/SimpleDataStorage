Simple Data Warehouse (extract, transform, load, query)
You are going to write a simple backend application that exposes data - extracted from a csv file
- via an API.
The file can be found here
http://adverity-challenge.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/PIxSyyrIKFORrCXfMYqZBI.csv
Transform it to your needs so it can be loaded into your favorite data store.
The API should make it possible to query the data in a generic and efficient way.
Possible queries might look like this:
● Total Clicks for a given Datasource for a given Date range
● Click-Through Rate (CTR) per Datasource and Campaign
● Impressions over time (daily)
And the data looks like this:
● a time dimension (Date)
● regular dimensions (Campaign, Datasource)
● metrics (Clicks, Impressions)
As a hint, the API consumes these parameters
● a set of metrics (plus calculated ones) to be aggregated on
● an optional set of dimensions to be grouped by
● an optional set of dimension filters to be filtered on
Tech / architecture
Feel free to
● Choose any JVM based language and framework
● Design any architecture that fits the problem/usecase best
● Model the API contract on your behalf
● Use any additional tech that helps extracting, transforming, loading and querying data
Deliverable
● Publish your solution on GitHub
● Deploy it somewhere so that the API can be publicly queried from
